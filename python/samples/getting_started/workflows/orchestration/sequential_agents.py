"""
Sample: Sequential workflow (agent-focused API) with shared conversation context

Build a high-level sequential workflow using SequentialBuilder and two domain agents.
The shared conversation (list[ChatMessage]) flows through each participant. Each agent
appends its assistant message to the context. The workflow outputs the final conversation
list when complete.

Note on internal adapters:
- Sequential orchestration inserts ConversationEntry/ConversationProjection/ConversationOutput
  nodes (IDs "conversation-entry", "conversation-view:<participant>", and "conversation-output").
  These appear in the event stream for observability but remain hidden by default in visualization tools.

Prerequisites:
- Azure OpenAI access configured for AzureOpenAIChatClient (use az login + env vars)

    ------------------------------------------------------------
    01 [user]
    Write a tagline for a budget-friendly eBike.
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    02 [writer]
    Ride farther, spend lessâ€”your affordable eBike adventure starts here.
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    03 [reviewer]
    This tagline clearly communicates affordability and the benefit of extended travel, making it
    appealing to budget-conscious consumers. It has a friendly and motivating tone, though it could
    be slightly shorter for more punch. Overall, a strong and effective suggestion!
